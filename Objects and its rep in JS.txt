1. In Javascript, objects may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types in "key:value" pairs.

2. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.

3. Objects and different from the primitive data types such as numbers, strings, boolean etc.

4. A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.

5. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.

6. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.

7. An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string.
